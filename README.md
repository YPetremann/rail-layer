## Description

The Rail Layer locomotive is a slow-moving, automated rail construction vehicle that lay down ghost rail and signals using materials from its cargo wagons.

Perfect for building large-scale railways without construction robots.

## Features

- **Ghost Blueprint Integration**: Reads placed ghost rail and signal entities
- **Automated Rail Construction**: Places rails and signals automatically as the locomotive moves
- **Resource Consumption**: Uses materials from train cargo wagons
- **Backward Laying**: when the Rail Layer goes backward, rails are laid from the back of the train.

## How To Use

1. **Blueprint Planning**: Plan your desired route with blueprints or ghost rails.
2. **Deploy Rail Layer**: Place the Rail Layer and a cargo wagons filled with rails and signals.
3. **Drive Forward**: Either by jumping in or driving remotely, simply drive like toward thoses ghost.
4. **Automatic Construction**: The locomotive will handle the work of automatically building rails and signals.

## Technical Details

- **Technology** just after railway transportation, 200x (1 red science pack, 1 green science pack)
- **Recipe** same as a locomotive
- **Maximum Speed** it goes at 1/4 speed of a locomotive, as it need to precisely build your rails
- **Script Efficient** script are used only when moving

## Compatibility
- ✔️ **Modded rails** that are either simple rails or correctly listen to script_raised_revive are compatible.
- ✔️ **Quality** is compatible.
- ‼️ **Elevated Rails** is compatble, but rail layer can't lay down elevated rails.

## Things To Do

- **Elevated Rails**: building rail support and supporting rails
- **Obstacle Clearing**: Cleanning Trees and Rocks marked for deconstruction and put items in Cargo Wagon
